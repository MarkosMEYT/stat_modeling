 This project aims to build on existing research by developing a predictive model for stroke occurrence based on multiple risk factors, including age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking, gender, work type, residence type, average glucose level, and BMI. This research paper includes an analysis of a dataset that has information about a patientâ€™s medical history, lifestyle, and demographic characteristics using statistical techniques, including logistic regression and lasso regression. The goal of the research paper is to identify the most significant risk factors for stroke occurrence and advise targeted prevention strategies to improve patient outcomes. Specifically we anticipate that older age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking, and higher average glucose levels will be significant risk factors.
